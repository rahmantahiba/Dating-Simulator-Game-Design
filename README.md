# Game-Design-Project

The current progress of the creation of my visual novel game. It was on hiatus but many changes will be made to the game script. 

- I do not have a artist so the characters are from google images. 

Goals:

- Update game script cause I want to make it where users have more freedom to determine their ending. 

- Add signature game soundtrack for home screen and in-game 

- Searching for ways to create animation.
